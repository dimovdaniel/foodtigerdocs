# iPhone App

## POD install

Firs you will need to install the cocoa pods. To do that, navigate to the ios folder and execute pod install

```text
cd ios
pod install
```

As reference, look in this video. Watch until 4:25

## Run the app on Simulator

Soon as you have installed your pods installed, you can run your app on simulator.  
To do that, navigate to the project root folder. The execute `npm run ios`

```text
cd ..
npm run ios 
```

This should start the app on the simulator

As reference, look in this video. Watch until the end.

As you can see the video, I get and error the first time, then run the same command again, and all worked ok.  If you run into problem, run the command `npm run ios` again. If you still get at error, send us a message of the error that you get in the console.
